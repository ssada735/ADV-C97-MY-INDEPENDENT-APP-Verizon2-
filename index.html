<p>Verizon is an American wireless network operator. The mobile network previously operated as a separate division of Verizon Communications under the name of Verizon Wireless. In a 2019 reorganization, Verizon moved the wireless products and services into two new divisions, Verizon Consumer and Verizon Business, and stopped using the Verizon Wireless name. Verizon is the second-largest wireless carrier in the United States, with 120.9 million subscribers as of the end of Q4 2020.[4]

The company is headquartered in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. It was founded in 2000 as a joint venture of American telecommunications firm Bell Atlantic, which would soon become Verizon Communications, and British multinational telecommunications company Vodafone.[5] Verizon Communications became the sole owner in 2014 after buying Vodafone's 45-percent stake in the company.[6]

It operates a national 4G LTE network covering about 99 percent of the U.S. population,[7] which in the second half of 2020 won or tied for top honors in each category of the RootMetrics RootScore Reports.[8] Verizon Wireless offers mobile phone services through a variety of devices.[9] Its LTE in Rural America Program, with 21 rural wireless carriers participating, covers 2.7 million potential users in 169 rural counties.[10] Verizon Wireless announced in 2015 that it was developing a 5G, or fifth-generation, network.[11]

The company is headquartered in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. It was founded in 1998 as a joint venture of American telecommunications firm Bell Atlantic, which would soon become Verizon Communications, and British multinational telecommunications company Vodafone.[5] Verizon Communications became the sole owner in 2014 after buying Vodafone's 45-percent stake in the company.[6]

In April 2000, the companies announced that the Bell Atlantic–GTE merger would take the name Verizon and that the Bell Atlantic–Vodafone wireless unit would be called Verizon Wireless (legally Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless).[13] Verizon Communications owned 55 percent of Verizon Wireless while Vodafone retained 45 percent ownership.[5] Regulators with the Federal Communications Commission approved the Bell Atlantic–GTE merger on June 16, 2000,[14] creating the largest wireless company in the United States.[15] Verizon Wireless held this market position until Cingular acquired AT&T Wireless Services in 2004.[16]

Throughout the 2000s, Verizon acquired several wireless phone companies and assets across the country, including West Virginia Wireless in 2006;[17] Ramcell in 2007;[18] Rural Cellular Corporation[19] and SureWest Communications, both in 2008.[20] Also in 2008, Verizon struck a deal to buy Alltel for $5.9 billion in equity while assuming $22.2 billion worth of debt.[21][22] The deal finalized January 9, 2009, again making Verizon Wireless the country's biggest cellphone network.[21] As per the agreement, Verizon sold rural wireless properties across 18 states to AT&T. Those properties were in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.[23] Verizon's acquisitions continued in the 2010s, including the purchases of some Plateau Wireless markets in 2012[24] and Golden State Cellular's operator in 2014.[25] </p>
